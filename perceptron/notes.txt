1) when the given data is in fact linearly seperable, the Rosenblatt seems to converge only in one epoch
2) as the data is not seperated linearly, the Rosenblatt oscilates incredibly from epoch to epoch (%95 succes drops to %50 in only one epoch)
3) when the input data is normalized (height is divided by 1.8 and weight is divided by 80, the converge is way faster than when it is not normalized)
